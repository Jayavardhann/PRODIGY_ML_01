Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

Overview:
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
It includes training the model using a provided train.csv dataset and making predictions on a separate test.csv dataset.

Additional Information:
The training set includes attributes like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and sale prices.
The model is trained on these features to predict house prices.

Requirements:
Python 3
pandas
sci-kit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Note:
The model is a basic linear regression model and might require further optimization or fine-tuning for better performance.
